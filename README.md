🚀 Getting Started

Method 1: Manual Mode (No Install Required)

If you don't want to install Node.js, you can manually list your apps.

Open index.html.

Locate the APPS_CONFIG array inside the <script> tag.

Add your app details manually:

{
    id: 'my-app',
    title: 'My Cool App',
    description: 'Does amazing things.',
    path: 'apps/my-app/index.html',
    category: 'Tools',
    icon: '🔧',
    color: 'from-blue-500 to-cyan-500'
}


🌍 Deployment

GitHub Pages

Push this repository to GitHub.

Go to Settings > Pages.

Select the main branch as the source.

Your portal is now live! The relative paths ensure all your sub-apps work instantly.

🛠️ Customization

Colors: The scanner assigns default slate colors. You can modify scan_apps.js or index.html to randomize gradients.

Icons: By default, the scanner assigns a 🚀 icon. You can edit the config.js after generation or enhance the scanner to look for specific meta tags for icons.
